# Conductor Workflow Rules

## 1. Pre-Implementation Scan
**Trigger**: Before any `conductor:implement` or `jules:run`.
**Action**: Run `gemini security scan`.
**Goal**: Identify potential PII leaks or GDPR bypasses in the plan.

## 2. Agent Node Redaction Verification
**Trigger**: When `src/lib/agents/nodes.ts` is modified.
**Action**: Verify that the `structurerNode` (Redaction/Privacy layer) is NOT bypassed. All input text must theoretically pass through checking logic.

## 3. Autonomous Code Review
**Trigger**: On every Pull Request (generated by Jules or Human).
**Action**: Run `gemini code-review`.
**Focus**: 
*   Type Safety (TypeScript strict mode).
*   Architecture Compliance (State Immutability).
*   Error Handling (Fail-Open patterns).
